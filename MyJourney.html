									<h2>My Journey</h2>
									<p>My journey as a Data Analyst has been shaped by a deep curiosity and a commitment to continuous growth. It all began with my passion for mathematics, which led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, graduating in 2015. This strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving naturally steered me towards data analysis, where I could apply my quantitative skills to real-world challenges.</p>

In 2016, shortly after graduating, I secured my first internship as a Data Analyst. This role was pivotal in my career, as it provided me with hands-on experience in data manipulation, reporting, and analysis. During this one-year internship, I honed my skills in Excel and SQL, developing a solid understanding of how data can be leveraged to drive business decisions. The experience fueled my curiosity and motivated me to deepen my expertise in the field.</p>

My dedication to improving my analytical skills paid off when, in 2019, I landed my first full-time and permanent role as a Data Analyst. This position allowed me to work on more complex projects, where I was responsible for analyzing large datasets, developing reports, and creating data visualizations that informed business strategies. I quickly became proficient in tools like Tableau and Power BI, which enabled me to present data in a way that was both accessible and actionable for stakeholders.</p>

Later that year, my contributions and leadership potential were recognized, and I was promoted to Team Lead. From 2019 to 2022, I led a team of analysts, guiding them in the development of data-driven solutions and ensuring that our insights aligned with the company’s strategic goals. During this time, I also took on more responsibilities, such as collaborating with cross-functional teams to implement data strategies and mentoring junior analysts. My leadership role taught me the importance of teamwork and communication in delivering impactful data insights.</p>

However, I realized that to stay at the forefront of the rapidly evolving data field, I needed to further my education. In 2022, I made the decision to pursue a Master’s degree in Data Analytics. This academic pursuit allowed me to delve deeper into advanced analytical techniques, including machine learning, predictive modeling, and big data management. The rigorous coursework and hands-on projects during my MSc program significantly enhanced my technical skills and equipped me with the knowledge to tackle even more complex data challenges.</p>

Since graduating in 2023, I have been actively developing and practicing my data analytics skills through personal projects, online courses, and collaborations. I’ve also been diligently searching for the right opportunity to apply my enhanced skill set in a professional setting. My journey has been marked by continuous learning and growth, and I am eager to bring my experience and expertise to a new role where I can make a significant impact.</p>

Today, as a Data Analyst, I am passionate about using data to solve problems and drive innovation. My journey from a mathematics graduate to a team lead and now a master’s degree holder has given me a well-rounded perspective on data analysis. I am excited about the future and look forward to contributing to data-driven decision-making in meaningful and impactful ways.</p>
